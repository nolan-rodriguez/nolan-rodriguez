# Hello, World!
I am Nolan, a 16 year old who has been breaking Linux for a decade.
## Programming
I don't really code that much, so I don't really belong on GitHub, but when I do program, it is usually in bash, which is the Linux terminal and programming language. I want to start learning a new language, probably Python or JavaScript, though I've heard that learning a low level language like C first is beneficial. Unfortunately, I can't really find many good places to start learning, if you have suggestions, feel free to shoot me an email.
## Projects
When I had time, I was working on [ubuntu-fixer](https://github.com/nolan-rodriguez/ubuntu-fixer), a script for removing the undesirable parts of Ubuntu, the popular Linux distribution. When I have time again, I will add scripts for the other Ubuntu flavors.
